# jelly

Jelly is meant to be a configurable status board for large-screen monitors/kiosks. We'll see how far it actually gets though.

## Usage

FIXME: write

Evaluate the load-sources line in project.clj. After that, you can call:

(map jelly.graphics/new-window (jelly.rss/retrieve-all-feed-titles))

Each rss headline will appear in its own window and scroll to the right.

## Installation

Be sure to first make jogl.jar available on your classpath. Available at http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/archive/jsr-231-1.1.1a/
